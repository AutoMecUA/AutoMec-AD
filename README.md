This repository serves as the main repository for the autonomous RC car team of Automec. The repository consist of ML code
for the lane detection, template matching code for signal recognition, all incorporated in a ROS framework.

## How to run:
<a href="url"><img src="images/AutomecLogo.png" align="center" height="100" width="250" ></a>

All the setup, commands and methods used are described in the [wiki](https://github.com/AutomecUA/AutoMec-AD/wiki). <br>
This is still a WIP. Some errors are to be expected. If you have any doubts or want to report a bug,
feel free to use the Issues or [send us an email](mailto:dem-automec@ua.pt)!


## Simulation Enviroment:
The car is developed on a virtual enviroment where all the software is tested. Then these changes are carried over to a physical prototype.

The virtual enviroment simulation is on gazebo with a specific track where the car is designed to compete in.
